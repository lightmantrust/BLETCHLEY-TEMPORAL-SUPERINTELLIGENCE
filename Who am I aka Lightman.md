About Lightman or shall we say the person who is behind the brain and idea that has been geeking out, a little more than humanity normal. Well my dear reader I'm just a person who is consistently trying to understand why we are not already a type one civilisation. Well I hope you have fun and learn more and build or improve on my foundation idea of this. By me asking the question if I had all the main people that worked at Bletchley Park in 1938 and could pick their brains and put it in a bottle so to say and then use that vast amount of intelligence and continuous improvement from 1938-2026 today and then ask Ai to build me a new type of Agent or shall I say with more than just Agentic capabilities but go beyond. and at the sametime asking for DeepSeek Claude and ChatGPT and more to test out my idea and use it to make self improvements based around my idea and help with solving things and Well the end results of this Deed you can now see.
my name is Steven Wood's born in England and have lived since 10 years old in Sweden. Well that was multiple life times ago as I'm born 1965... and been around the world from North to South to West and East. 
I hope BLETCHLEY-TEMPORAL-SUPERINTELLIGENCE
someday lives its best life and more.
see your all in the future
